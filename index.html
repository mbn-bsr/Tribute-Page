  <h2>Below are <i>a few </i>of Tony's inventions</h2>
  <ul id="tribute-info">
    <li><strong>Iron Man Mark 1</strong> - Made in cave</li>
    <li><strong>Ultron</strong> - Not sure if a great success or failure as it had a mind of its own, which wasn't intended to be</li>
    <li><strong>E.D.I.T.H Glasses</strong> - This invention is highly dangerous because anybody can get their hands on them. Even from the grave, Tony Stark's inventions still cause massive issues. The E.D.I.T.H glasses are powered with artificial intelligence and control weapons of mass destruction upon voice command.</li>
    <li><strong>Iron Spider Armor</strong> - This invention proves that no matter how powerful a superhero is, there's always room for growth with a Tony Shark invention.</li>
    <li><strong>The Arc Reactor</strong> - Clean energy that powers his suit, his house and him</li>
    <li><strong>Badassium</strong> - This is the name Tory gave to an element. It was his father's idea (element, not the name) but son was to carry out the invention of the element</li>
    <li><strong>J.A.R.V.I.S.</strong> - This is Artificial Intelligence but next level, same as all of the above</li>
  </ul>
